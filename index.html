        <h2>Problem Statement: Busy Schedule with Confusion</h2>
        <p>
          Students are busy and managing time is important. This is not
          helped by the fact that different professors may use completely 
          different systems for managing classwork and homework. It is 
          confusing when homework for one class is submitted by email while
          another is submitted on Blackboard and another on dropbox.

        <p>
          In this affinity diagram the group laid out our various thoughts about solving our problem. Our main idea is a web-app that could handle all the tasks we throw at it, so we thought up all most important features along with challenges and potential problems. The biggest problems we identified were reliability and implementation. The biggest benefit is ease of use, which is the main focus.
