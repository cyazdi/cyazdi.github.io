        <h2>Problem Statement: Confusion Management</h2>
        <p>
          Students are busy and managing time is important. This is not
          helped by the fact that different professors may use completely 
          different systems for managing classwork and homework. It is 
          confusing when homework for one class is submitted by email while
          another is submitted on Blackboard and another on dropbox.
